# mongodb with mocha
I have implemented a application which uses mongoDB, robomongo, mongoose, mocha for testing.

# Installation
1. clone the repo to any directory.
2. run `npm install` or `yarn add`

# Usage
I have created two models (author and mariochar). MongoDB Connections are available at `connection.js` file.

We can create, delete, update, find the record in the mongoDB.

Before performing any CURD operations create a directory with name `data` and another directory named `db` in `data` directory in `C:/` local disk.

Then run `node run test` command in your command prompt or terminal.

# Tools used

1. [MongoDB!](https://www.mongodb.com/)
2. [Mongoose!](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)
3. [Robomongo!](https://robomongo.org/)
